# iosProject_OnlyZachsMusic

Individual project for UVM CS 275: Mobile App Development

This app displays only Zach's music. No other music is allowed! 

In addition Jason: I was unable to find a good solution for the UITableViewCellReorderControl color. By default it is grey, I tried to make it white, but clicking on them sets them back to grey unfortunately.
